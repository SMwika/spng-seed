SharePoint / AngularJS App Seed Project
=========

This is a test project designed to be a seed project (or eventually a Visual Studio Template) to implement a SharePoint single-page App built using AngularJS with a heavy emphasis on MVC design patterns.

The project structure is built to be very familiar to any ASP.NET MVC developer, while providing a good starting point for a simple (or complex) SharePoint AngularJS based App.

Initial version notes:
- VS2013 SharePoint Hosted App Project Template
- NUGET AngularJS-Core package
- Folder structure as per ASP.NET MVC pattern (/Controllers, /Models, /Views, etc)
- Sample Model, View and Controller including directive and services to recreate the "'Hello ' + user.get_title()" default template functionality.
