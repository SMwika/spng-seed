SharePoint / AngularJS App Seed Project
=========

This is a test project designed to be a seed project (or eventually a Visual Studio Template) to implement a SharePoint single-page App built using AngularJS with a heavy emphasis on MVC design patterns.

The project structure is built to be very familiar to any ASP.NET MVC developer, while providing a good starting point for a simple (or complex) SharePoint Angular based App.
